# flaskr
Complete and working tutorial from Flasks official documentation page http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/
Have also included wsgi file details for remote deployment.

# Mac local_machine deployment

## Activating flask server:
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run


## Initialise the database
    flask init-db

# Pythonanywhere deployment - build & install
Upload installation wheel file to files folder.
    mkvirtualenv flaskr --python=/usr/bin/python3.7

commands for venv:
    # to activate the venv in pythonanywhere, just type workon and the venv name.
    workon flaskr
    
    # to activate in bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # to deativate the venv      
    deactivate

## load Flask    
    acitvate venv
    
    pip install wheel
    python setup.py bdist_wheel     # not sure why this is not working on Ubuntu 16.04?
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    pip3 install flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

Pip will install your project along with its dependencies.

Since this is a different machine, you need to run init-db again to create the database in the instance folder.
    
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    flask init-db

When Flask detects that itâ€™s installed (not in editable mode), it uses a different directory for the instance folder. You can find it at venv/var/flaskr-instance instead.

### Configure the Secret Key
In the beginning of the tutorial that you gave a default value for SECRET_KEY. This should be changed to some random bytes in production. Otherwise, attackers could use the public 'dev' key to modify the session cookie, or anything else that uses the secret key.

You can use the following command to output a random secret key:

    python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'

    b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'

Create the config.py file in the instance folder, which the factory will read from if it exists. Copy the generated value into it.

venv/var/flaskr-instance/config.py
    SECRET_KEY = b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'
You can also set any other necessary configuration here, although SECRET_KEY is the only one needed for Flaskr.

Set up a new wsgi file

## create new wsgi file and write:

    ## wsgi_file.py
    import sys

    # add your project directory to the sys.path
    project_home = u'/home/GMM/flaskr/'
    if project_home not in sys.path:
        sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

    # You can't import a variable that is local to a function, so we need to call
    # the function inside the application-factory to buid and return the app.

    from flaskr import create_app
    application = create_app()

# VirMach remote Ubuntu 16.04, apache2 deployment
/etc/apache2/sites-available/sites.wsgi file
Place each site on it's own port and include it's own WSGI daemon process, this will prevent any data leakage between each site.

TODO
- check and see why pytest is not running? may have something to do with the file location of setup.cfg? or may have something to do with what directory you are in when you run $ pytest from the CLI ? http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/tests/
